We develop a **real-time Spatiotemporal Tube (STT) framework** for multi-agent systems with **unknown dynamics**, where each agent is assigned a **social awareness index** representing its level of altruism or egoism.

This framework:
- synthesizes **STTs online** for each agent,
- incorporates heterogeneous social behaviors through a Social Interaction Function,
- ensures **prescribed-time reach–avoid–stay (TRAS)** satisfaction,
- handles **dynamic obstacles** and **unknown disturbances**, and
- guarantees **inter-agent collision avoidance** in a socially consistent way.

### Key Contributions
- A decentralized, **model-free**, closed-form control law.  
- Real-time STT construction that adapts tube centers and radii based on social behavior.  
- Incorporates altruistic–egoistic interactions formally via the **Social Awareness Index**.  
- Scalable to large teams: demonstrated on **2D omni robots** and **3D UAVs**.  
- Validated through both simulation and hardware experiments.
