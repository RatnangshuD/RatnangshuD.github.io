I am a Prime Minister’s Research Fellow at the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems (RBCCPS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, where I work in the FOCAS Lab under the guidance of Prof. Pushpak Jagtap. My research broadly focuses on **formal methods** and developing **scalable, disturbance-robust control frameworks** for unknown nonlinear dynamics under complex **temporal logic specifications**.

My recent work focuses on a **Spatiotemporal Tube (STT)-based control framework** that provides model-free, closed-form controllers for unknown systems. Over time, I have extended STTs to support a wide spectrum of tasks, including **temporal reach–avoid**, the full class of **STL specifications**, learning from demonstration **(LfD)**, and **real-time dynamic obstacle avoidance**. STTs also enable rich multi-agent capabilities, such as **negotiation-based coordination**, **learning-driven interaction**, and **socially aware navigation**. STTs have also served as a formal foundation for constructing **Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)**, offering a principled way to build safety certificates for complex systems.
I am also working on temporal logic **resilience** to quantify how much disturbance a system can tolerate while still satisfying temporal logic specifications.

Beyond this, I work on approximation-free symbolic control for unknown systems, where symbolic abstractions are used to construct **virtual confinement zones (VCZs)** in the state space along with closed-form controllers that guarantee invariance and safety. I am also developing a parallel computing framework using multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and modern hardware accelerators to enable **scalable abstraction and symbolic control synthesis** for higher-dimensional systems.
