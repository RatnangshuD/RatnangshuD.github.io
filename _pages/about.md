Hello! I am Ratnangshu Das, a Prime Minister Research Fellow at the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems [RBCCPS](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) in the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, working on control of unknown systems under complex specifications in the [FOCAS Lab](https://www.focaslab.com/) under the guidance of Prof. Pushpak Jagtap.

My recent works include developing a novel Spatiotemporal Tube-based control formulation which offers a closed-form solution to satisfy reach-avoid-stay specifications in unknown systems. Currently, I am interested in extending my work to general temporal logic specifications and multi-agent systems.

I completed my B.Tech and M.Tech from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
