I am a Prime Minister’s Research Fellow at the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems (RBCCPS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, working in the [FOCAS Lab](https://www.focaslab.com/) under [Prof. Pushpak Jagtap](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Szd98jUAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on formal methods and scalable, disturbance-robust control for unknown nonlinear systems, particularly under complex temporal logic specifications.

A major part of my work involves developing a **Spatiotemporal Tube (STT)-based control framework**, which provides model-free, closed-form controllers with strong robustness guarantees. Over time, I have extended STTs to support a wide spectrum of tasks, including temporal reach–avoid tasks, the full class of STL specifications, learning from demonstration, real-time dynamic obstacle avoidance, and multi-agent coordination such as negotiation-based control, learning-based interactions, and socially aware navigation. They also provide a formal foundation for constructing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).

I also work on temporal logic **resilience**, studying how much disturbance a system can tolerate while still satisfying temporal specifications. In parallel, I am developing approximation-free symbolic control using **virtual confinement zones (VCZs)** and closed-form controllers for unknown systems, and building a parallel computing framework to scale **symbolic control** synthesis to higher-dimensional systems.
